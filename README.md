A really simple Flashcard app written in Python as a learning exercise. I'm learning Vietnamese so it made sense choosing this language. 

The user is being shown a word in Vietnamese in the form of a card. After 4 seconds the card flips with the correct translation in English. 

A user can:
  * Click the Tick button if they knew the word and guessed the translation.
  * Click the X button if they did not.

When you click Tick, the word is taken out of the pool of words as the user signified they know the word. Clicking X keeps the word in the pool for repetition. 
The pool is saved in a csv file locally.
